### The SADX Speedrun Mod!

- Quick Save Reloader - Reload save file every time you quit to the menu
- Gamma IL Timer - Time your gamma levels with true in-game time using the [External IL Timer](https://github.com/skewbmaster/SADXILTimer/releases/latest)

Place the "sadx-speedrun-mod" folder from the zip in your sadx "mods" folder to install the mod.
**MAKE SURE TO CONFIGURE THE MOD BEFORE YOU RUN YOUR GAME**
The configuration tooltips should tell you what the settings do but ask if you are having problems.

Future releases should auto-update if you check for updates in your mod manager, happy running CatBoo

Quick troubleshooting: if the mod doesn't load, download and install the latest 2015-2022 x86 vc redist at this link: https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x86.exe
